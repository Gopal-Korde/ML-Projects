# Price Regression Model Comparison

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to predict price using machine learning regression techniques and compare the performance of multiple regression models.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains numerical and categorical features that influence price. Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values and feature scaling are applied.

## Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets  
4. Training multiple regression models  
5. Model evaluation and comparison  
6. Selecting the best performing model  

## Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  

## Results and Conclusion
The project compares multiple regression models and identifies the most suitable model based on evaluation metrics. Tree-based models performed better for capturing non-linear relationships.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
