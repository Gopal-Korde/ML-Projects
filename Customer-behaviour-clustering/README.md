# 🧠 Customer Behavior Analysis using K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer behavior analysis is a crucial task for businesses to understand different types of customers and design effective marketing strategies.  
This project uses **unsupervised machine learning techniques** to segment customers based on their demographic and spending behavior.

Two clustering algorithms are implemented and compared:
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical (Agglomerative) Clustering**

The project demonstrates how clustering helps identify meaningful customer groups without labeled data.

## 🎯 Objective
- Segment customers into distinct groups based on behavior
- Compare **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**
- Extract actionable business insights from clusters
- Visualize customer segments clearly

---

## 📊 Dataset
**Dataset:** Mall Customers Dataset  

**Features Used:**
- Age  
- Annual Income (k$)  
- Spending Score (1–100)

The dataset represents customer demographic and purchasing behavior collected from a shopping mall.
